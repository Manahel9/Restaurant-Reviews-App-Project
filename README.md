## Instructions
 1-Download the file
 
 2-In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

 3-In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000` For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 9000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

4-With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:9000`.
